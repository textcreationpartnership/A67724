            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THO' no Profeſſion is more Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Profitable than that of the Law, witneſs the many great Titles and vaſt Eſtates acquired thereby, yet (perhaps) it is of all other Studies the leaſt Pleaſant and Entertaining, which (no doubt) is the Reaſon that ſo few are contented with the Honour to know It, without the other Encouragement; and to ſuch as have That, I do not ſay it is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant; or if it be, yet when the Pill is Gilt, it is eaſily ſwallowed. However, in ſome ſence every Man is a Lawyer, that is, ſuppoſed to be ſo; ſo Charitable is the Law to allow Ignorance in none, becauſe every Man would make that his Excuſe, and none could tell how to confute him. And (as the Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> ſays) it is
<pb facs="tcp:53778:3"/>
irrational to ſuppoſe Men ignorant of thoſe Laws for the breach of which they are to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>But how Intricate ſoever this Study may ſeem in general, it cannot be imagined but that among ſo great variety of Caſes there will be found ſome of a double Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as well to pleaſe as to inſtruct.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort, Reader, is the Collection I here preſent you with, taken from the Reports, and other Authentick Books of Law, all along moſt faithfully quoted and referred to.</p>
            <p>Some may Object againſt the Method, or indeed that I have uſed none, but this let the Table anſwer, there being many Things that follow naturally enough, which yet cannot properly be reduced under the ſame Head; my Deſign herein being chiefly to Delight, which I thought cou'd not be ſo effectually done any other way by</p>

            <p>BEfore I come to particular Caſes, it may not be impertinent, I hope, to conſider a little what is meant by theſe Words the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,</hi> perhaps not ſo commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as imagined, ſince I find the Learned themſelves differ about them; and firſt let us ſee what is ſaid in <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. there you may obſerve that by the <hi>Common Law</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſuch things as were Law before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Statute made in that point that is in queſtion, ſo as that point was holden for Law by the general or particular <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> or by the Law of Reaſon, and the Law of God, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law added to them by Statute, or otherwiſe. For Inſtance, It is ſaid that at the <hi>Common Law</hi> Tenant by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, and Tenant in Dower were puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Waſte, <hi>i. e.</hi> that before any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Waſte made, they ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for it by the Grounds and Maxims of the Law uſed before the Statute made in that point; But Tenant for Life or
<pb facs="tcp:53778:8"/>
Years were not puniſhable by the ſaid Grounds and Maxims 'till remedy was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt them by Statute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid that at the <hi>Common Law</hi> they were not puniſhable for Waſte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glanvil</hi> and <hi>Bracton</hi> affirm that the Law of <hi>England</hi> was <hi>Jus non ſcriptum</hi> in their times: And Sir <hi>John Davies</hi> ſays (in the Preface to his Reports) that our Ancient Reports of the Law are but Comments or Interpretations upon the <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> which <hi>Text</hi> (ſays he) was never originally written, but hath ever been preſerved in the memory of Men, tho' no Man's memory can reach to the Original of it, for (goes he on) the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is nothing elſe but the Common Cuſtom of the Realm, and a Cuſtom which hath obtained the force of a Law is always ſaid to be <hi>Jus non ſcriptum,</hi> for it cannot be made or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either by Charter or by Parliament, which are Acts reduced to Writing, and are always matter of Record; but being only matter of Fact, and conſiſting in uſe and practice, it can be Recorded and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred no where but in the memory of the People, for a Cuſtom takes beginning and grows to perfection thus; when a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Act once done is found to be good and beneficial to the People, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:53778:8"/>
to their nature and diſpoſition, then do they uſe it and practice it again and again, and ſo by frequent iteration and multiplication of the Act, it becomes a Cuſtom, and being continued without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption time out of mind, it obtains the force of a Law. So far Sir <hi>John Davies:</hi> But ſure what the Lord <hi>Vaughan</hi> lays down, <hi>fol.</hi> 163. is very conſonant to Reaſon, that in truth moſt of the Common Law cannot be conceived to be Law otherwiſe than by Acts of Parliament, or Power equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to them, whereof the Rolls are loſt, for always there was a Power and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of making new Laws: And again <hi>fol.</hi> 358. Many things are ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and indeed moſt things ſo prohibited were primarily forbidden by Parliament, or by a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er equivalent to it in making Laws, which is the ſame, but are ſaid to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> becauſe the original of the Conſtitution or Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Law is not to be found of Record, but is beyond memory, and the Law known only from practical proceeding and uſage in Courts of Juſtice, as may appear by many Laws made in the time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, of <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, yet extant in Hiſtory, which are now received as <hi>Common Law.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53778:9"/>
So if by accident the Records of all Acts of Parliament now extant, none of which is elder than 9 <hi>H.</hi> III. (but new Laws were as frequent before as ſince) ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Fire, or other Caſualty, the Memorials of Proceeding upon them found by the Records in Judicial Proceeding, would upon like reaſon be accounted <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi> by Poſterity.</p>

Divorce, being <hi>ex cauſâ ſubſequente,</hi> and only a Separation <hi>à Menſa &amp; Thoro,</hi> freeing the Parties from the performance of Conjugal duties only, the one with the other. <hi>Vide Cro.

               </p>
               <p>In the Caſe of <hi>Ann Porter,</hi> as reported by <hi>Crook,</hi> it was ſaid by the Court, If ſhe were ſuffered to be within the Proviſo, many would be Divorced upon ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Scil.

Note the Decree was, <hi>Quod propter Saeviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> of her Husband towards her, ſhe ſhould be ſeparated <hi>à Menſâ &amp; Thoro</hi> from him; but no Word of <hi>Divorciamus</hi> was therein; and expreſly intimated in the Sentence, that ſhe ſhould not marry to any other during the life of the ſaid <hi>Porter.</hi>

Cor. tit. Felenies by Stat.</hi> that this Branch of the Statute in reſpect of the generality of the Words, privelege the offender from being a Felon, as well in the caſe of the Divorce <hi>à Menſâ &amp; Thòro,</hi> as where it is <hi>à Vinculo Matrimonii;</hi> and yet in the caſe of the Divorce <hi>à Menſâ &amp; Thoro,</hi> the Second Marriage is void, living the former Wife or Husband. And if there be a Divorce <hi>à Vinculo Matrimonii,</hi> and the

               <p>IN the Lord <hi>Hobart</hi>'s Book, <hi>Fol.</hi> 120. is this Caſe.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Darcy,</hi> and <hi>Gervaſe Markham</hi> were hunting together, and <hi>Markham</hi> and one <hi>Beckwith</hi> (a Servant of my Lord's) fell together by the Ears in the Field, and <hi>Beckwith</hi> threw <hi>Markham</hi> down, and was upon him, cuffing of him; the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> took his Servant off, and reproved him, and yet <hi>Markham</hi> chid my Lord, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with maintaining his Man; the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> replied, That he had uſed him kindly, for if he had not reſcued him from his Man, he had beaten him to Rags; Whereupon <hi>Markham</hi> (after this) wrote five or ſix Letters to my Lord, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his Name to 'em, but ſent 'em not, but diſperſed them unſealed in the Fields, to this effect, That whereas the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> had ſaid, that but for him his Man <hi>Beckwith</hi> had beat him to Rags, he lyed, and as often as he ſhould ſpeak it he lyed, and that he would maintain with his Life; adding, That he had diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe Letters that he might find them, or that ſomebody elſe might bring them to him; and concluded, That if he were deſirous to ſpeak with him, he might ſend
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53778:42"/>
his Boy who ſhould be well uſed. My Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> ſued <hi>Markham</hi> for this in the Star-Chamber, who was fined 500 <hi>l.</hi> for the Letter thus diſperſed was in the nature of a Libel, ſlanderous and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory to my Lord, and tho' without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny direct challenge to fight, yet there were plain provocations to it, and as it were to call and challenge my Lord to challenge him: And <hi>Hobart</hi> in his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſaid, That the Law did not allow any Man to ſtrike in private revenge of ill Words, becauſe there is no proportion between <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Blows;</hi> but he that is ſtricken may ſtrike again. 'Tis true, there is a Judicial Combat allowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſtable if a Man be called <hi>Traytor,</hi> where for matter of ſatisfaction in point of Honour, (as it is called) it was left to the Lord Marſhal as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Court and Conſideration from the Star-Chamber.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Hob.</hi> ſaid alſo in this Caſe, That ſuch Inſolent Perſons (<hi>Challengers</hi> and <hi>Duelliſts</hi>) take upon them to frame a Law and Commonwealth to themſelves, as if they had power to caſt off the Yoke of Obedience to Peace and Juſtice, enacting among themſelves as an undoubted poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That a Man wronged may with his Sword in his Hand, require ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53778:43"/>
of any Man, being no Privy Counſellor, and with a mild Word to qualify the deteſtation of this kind of Murder, they have made it a familiar Phraſe, <hi>That he was killed fairly, and he was killed in equal fight,</hi> which Arrogancy and Rebellion muſt be ſubdued. And Judges and Jurors muſt not give way to this impious diſtinction of fair and foul Killing, but muſt execute the Law with ſeverity upon all Murtherers; for the Law knows no ſuch diſtinction: This he vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publickly to do, taking it to be the only Remedy againſt this damnable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The King approved this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, being pleaſed to ſay, The Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> did hit his own mind in it. (King <hi>James,</hi> we know, was a moſt Peaceable Prince.)</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſays, a Duel may ſtill be granted in ſome Caſes by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and only there. That the Church allowed it anciently appears by this, In their publick <hi>Liturgies</hi> there were Prayers appointed for the Duelliſts to ſay, the Judge uſed to bid them go to ſuch a Church and Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whether is this lawful? If you grant any War lawful, he makes no doubt to evince it: War is lawful, becauſe God is the only Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two, that is Supream: Now if a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53778:43"/>
difference happen between two Subjects, and it cannot be decided by human Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, (as I will give an inſtance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently) why may they not put it to God to judge between them by the permiſſion of the Prince? nay, what if one ſhould bring it down for Argument ſake to the Sword-Men; one gives me the Lye, 'tis a great diſgrace to take it, the Law has made no Proviſion to give remedy for the Injury, (If you can ſuppoſe any thing an Injury for which the Law gives no remedy) why am not I in this caſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, and may therefore right my ſelf?</p>
               <p>But now for the Inſtance I promiſed, it is in <hi>Fuller</hi>'s <hi>Holy War, Page</hi> 44. Thus,</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bovillon,</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) lived in the Court of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the Emperor, there happened an intricate Suit betwixt him and another Prince about Title of Land, and becauſe Judges could not untie the Knot, it was concluded the two Princes ſhould cut it aſſunder with their Swords in a Combat: <hi>Godfrey</hi> was very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to fight, not that he was the worſe Soldier, but the better Chriſtian: He made the Demurr not in his Courage, but in his Conſcience, as conceiving any private Title for Land not ground enough for a Duel; yea, we may obſerve gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53778:44"/>
that they who long moſt to fight Duels, are the firſt that Surfeit on them; Notwithſtanding he yielded to the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Cuſtom, and after the faſhion of the Country, (ſo it was uſed elſewhere beſides in <hi>England</hi>) entred the Liſts, when at the firſt encounter his Sword brake; but he ſtruck his Adverſary down with the Hilt, yet ſo that he ſaved his Life, and gained his own Inheritance.</p>
